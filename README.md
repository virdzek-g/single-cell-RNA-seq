# single cell RNA seq analysis
In this repository is shown a series of codes I have used for my analysis of single cell RNA-seq data of a particular immune cell subtype. The manuscript that includes this analysis is currently under review to be published.
I have divided the code into individual parts (QC, normalisation, clusering, data visualisation) that are availabale in this depository.

I am unable to provide any further information about the data, sequenced cells or results until the data is published.
